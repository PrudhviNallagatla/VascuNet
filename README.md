# VascuNet
 I implemented a UNet model within the "VascuNet" framework for blood vessel segmentation in a Kaggle competition focused on Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) kidney imaging. The model produced binary masks using high-resolution 3D TIFF data, with white areas representing blood vessels. I have achieved an outstanding validation accuracy of 0.9980 by comparing these masks, which were converted to Run-Length Encoding (RLE) format, with true masks. Advanced loss functions like the Dice coefficient and post-processing techniques were used to refine masks, enhancing visual quality and coherence. This rigorous approach ensured accurate segmentation and improved interpretability and reliability. The segmentation facilitated deeper insights into the vascular architecture of ex vivo kidney organs, aiding biomedical imaging and renal research advancements.
